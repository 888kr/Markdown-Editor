# Sync

Hello, I have recently created a project, **_Sync_** for fun and for personal purposes as I find the normal text / document editors very hard and over complicated, such as the top bar on word, google docs, etc...

Sync is a utility, productivity application, a alternative to normal text editors, simplified, easier to use, built from the popular Electron framework. Sync works fine offline and doesn't store cache but only exporting necessary files such as markdown files and Pdfs. 

MIT so you guys can take the code and do whatever with it



## Development
---
Sync uses primarily the following dependencies: html2pdf (apparently jsPDF doesn't work for me), marked (js library)
Overall, Sync doesn't use any external frameworks, runs on plain vanilla html, css, javascript.
