# Markdown Editor

Run `npm start` after saving your changes.

The preview area sanitizes Markdown to avoid executing unsafe HTML or scripts.

Math expressions written between dollar signs, like `$ax^2+bx+c=0$`, are rendered with MathJax.

The editor overlays a rendered preview so you see formatted content as you type.
